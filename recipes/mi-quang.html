    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mì Quảng, meaning 'Quảng Noodles' in English, is a hearty and flavorful
      noodle dish that originated from Quảng Nam Province in Central Vietnam,
      which is where I came from. It is a staple dish in my region and is, by
      far, my favorite dish ever. This recipe uses pork and prawns as toppings,
      but there are other variations that use different ingredients. The recipe
      was translated into English from
