      <li>Strained tomatoes: 7 oz (200g)</li>
      <li>Tomato paste (double-concentrated): 1 tbsp</li>
      <li>½ cup (1 glass) of whole milk (optional)</li>
      <li>Light meat or vegetable broth (or stock cubes)</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil: 3 tbsp</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a heavy non-stick 10-inch (24-26cm) casserole (aluminium or enamelled
        cast-iron (Dutch oven) or terracotta saucepans can be used), melt the
        ground or chopped pancetta with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a chef&apos;s or chopping knife, finely chop the onion, celery,
        and carrot (do not use a food processor); add the vegetables to the oil
        and pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden
        spoon until softened but not browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise the heat to medium and add the meat, break it up, then cook for
        about ten minutes, always stirring, until it sizzles and browns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the wine; cook over medium heat until it has completely evaporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomato paste and purée. Mix well; add a cup of boiling stock (or
        water) and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours (or 3 depending on
        preference and type of meat), adding hot broth (or water) as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add any milk (traditionally used) half way through the cooking; allow to
        evaporate completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pepper before serving. Once ready, the sauce will
        have a rich maroon hue and a thick, glossy texture. Serve it with flat
        pasta such as tagliatelle or pappardelle.
      </li>
    </ol>
