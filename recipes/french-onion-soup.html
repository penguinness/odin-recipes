      <li>1/2 cup (120ml) dry sherry (such as Amontillado)</li>
      <li>
        2 quarts (1.8L) homemade beef stock or homemade or store-bought

      </li>
      <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) Asian fish sauce (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) cider vinegar</li>
      <li>8 bowl-size slices rustic bread, toasted until crisp</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a large stainless steel saucepan, or in 2 large stainless steel or
          cast iron skillets, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming.
          Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8
          minutes. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until
          onions are very sweet and a rich golden-brown color, 1 to 2 hours. If
          browned onion juices on bottom of pot threaten to burn, add 1
          tablespoon (15ml) water, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking.
          Season with salt and pepper.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add sherry and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. (If
          using 2 skillets, divide sherry between them, then scrape onions and
          liquid from both pans into a pot or Dutch oven to continue.) Cook
          until alcohol smell is mostly gone, about 3 minutes. Add stock, thyme,
          and bay leaf; raise heat to medium-high; and bring to a simmer. Lower
          heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add fish sauce, if using, and cider vinegar. Season with salt and
          pepper. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.
        </p>

          Preheat broiler and adjust oven rack to top position. Butter toasts
          and rub with garlic clove until fragrant. Spoon a small amount of
          broth into the bottoms of 4 ovenproof serving bowls, then top with
          half the toasts. Sprinkle some grated cheese on top of toasts, then
          spoon more soup and onions on top, nearly filling bowls. Set remaining
          4 toasts in bowls, pushing to nearly submerge them. Top with remaining
          grated cheese and set bowls on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil until
          cheese is melted and browned in spots. Garnish with chives and serve.
